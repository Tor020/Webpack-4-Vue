# Note

May need to downgrade to webpack 3 until webpack 4 works out kinks with older plugins

The Config file should still work with Webpack 3. Certain changes might need to be made though involving the way that css is loaded. Just try to get it to work with webpack 4 first

## Todo

- Get it working with Pug (May not be working with webpack4)
- Add hot module reload (May not be working with webpack4)
- Get it working with Sass (May have to work around certain settings to get to work with miniCss)
